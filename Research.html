                            We investigate Italy’s centralized teacher assignment system where teachers can
                            rank “geographical regions”, leading to ties in their rank order lists (ROLs). We show
                            that the way ties in teachers’ ROLs are resolved in the current assignment mechanism
                            systematically violates teachers’ priority rights and results in justified envy. We propose
                            a new mechanism, Deferred Acceptance with Hierarchical Choice (DA-HC), which is
                            strategy-proof, eliminates justified envy, and Pareto improves over the benchmark deferred
                            acceptance mechanism with simple tie-breaking (DA-STB). Using administrative data,
                            we provide evidence that DA-HC can potentially bring significant welfare improvements
                            over the benchmark DA-STB.

                            vacancies on the distribution of teachers across schools. Motivated by the current
                            information disclosure policy in the Italian teacher labor market, we provide
                          insights on how to design informational interventions in centralized assignment
                          systems. To conduct the analysis, we construct a novel dataset by collecting public
                          announcements on teacher retirements, which are a relevant source of information about the next-year expected vacancies. 
                            Using a generalized difference-in-differences strategy, we find evidence of within-province distributional effects.

                            This paper studies the design of commitment constraints in the Italian teacher
assignment. This type of constraints is used as a retention policy instrument
in order to retain teachers in their current positions, and therefore to promote
teaching continuity. We show that the current system gives rise to a series of shortcomings due to a fundamental restriction of the strategy space, 
                            which prevents
teachers from fully signalling their preferences. In particular, teachers are forced
to participate in a multi-item lottery over schools if they want to request a single
school without commitment to stay. To address these issues we propose a market
design solution based on the matching with contracts framework, where we restore the complete strategy space, 
                            without artificially introducing additional contractual
possibilities. Our proposed mechanism removes the shortcomings while satisfying
desirable properties, such as strategy-proofness, non-wastefulness, elimination of
justified envy, respecting improvements, and a weaker form of Pareto efficiency.

                            Most secondary schools in England are able to design the rules for which pupils
                            have priority when the school is over-subscribed. 
                            This could be positive or negative for inclusivity, depending on schools’ choices. 
                            In this context, we study the detailed rules for each secondary school in England. 
                            Our main findings are that, first, geography (still) determines admission to most 
                            over-subscribed schools. This matters for social mobility, as some households 
                            are priced out of high performing schools due to higher property prices around 
                            the school. Second, despite explicit financial incentives, only a small minority 
                            of schools give priority to pupils eligible for the Pupil Premium, and this
                            priority is meaningful only in a few dozen schools. Third, the few schools 
                            with ‘innovative’ admissions arrangements could inspire other schools to implement 
                            feasible ‘tried and tested’ reforms. Free schools appear to be leading
                            these ‘innovative’ admissions arrangements. Finally, in the complex system of 
                            multiple school types and diverse admissions arrangements, parents in some areas
                            lack the required information to make informed school choices.

                            This paper explores the effect of language proficiency on Math achievement for ten-year-old
                second-generation immigrant children in Italian primary schools. Especially for these children, proficiency
                in the host country language is the prerequisite for the acquisition of any other skill. However, using an
                instrumental variable strategy that exploits the heterogeneity in birth dates and the variation in linguistic
                distances, we find that they face a trade-off between learning Italian and learning Math. The linguistic
                literature offers an explanation based on the existence of a language proficiency threshold that must be
                crossed to understand the classes. On this basis, we develop a simple model of skill production that provides
                theoretical foundations for our results and a unified framework for interpreting the mixed findings in the
                literature. We present empirical evidence that the trade-off arises when proficiency is below the threshold
                commonly adopted to indicate a sufficient command of the Italian language, which happens for 59% of
                our sample. Enabling these children to catch up requires substantial investments in education since, when
                a sufficiency threshold must be crossed, marginal improvements are ineffective, rendering the proficiency
                gap permanent and fostering social exclusion and inequality.
