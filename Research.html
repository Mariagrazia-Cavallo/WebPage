                            We investigate Italy’s centralized teacher assignment system where teachers can
                            rank “geographical regions”, leading to ties in their rank order lists (ROLs). We show
                            that the way ties in teachers’ ROLs are resolved in the current assignment mechanism
                            systematically violates teachers’ priority rights and results in justified envy. We propose
                            a new mechanism, Deferred Acceptance with Hierarchical Choice (DA-HC), which is
                            strategy-proof, eliminates justified envy, and Pareto improves over the benchmark deferred
                            acceptance mechanism with simple tie-breaking (DA-STB). Using administrative data,
                            we provide evidence that DA-HC can potentially bring significant welfare improvements
                            over the benchmark DA-STB.

                            Workers typically change positions multiple times throughout their career. As a result, in many labor markets, commitment constraints are widely adopted to force workers staying in their current
 position and reduce turnover. However, these constraints can be detrimental for workers’ welfare. Motivated by retention policy schemes adopted in the Italian teacher assignment system, I
 quantitatively evaluate the trade-off between teacher retention and teacher welfare under different
 policies. Using administrative data on tenured teacher mobility applications, I build and estimate
 a tractable dynamic model of teacher application behavior, where teachers are allowed to reapply
 across years and respond to dynamic incentives. Through counterfactual exercises, I show that
 policies offering score bonuses for remaining in a position can outperform those requiring teachers to wait before moving. However, I show that these bonus-based policies may be less effective
 in contexts like Italy, where geographical priorities are in place along with a point-based score system.

                            This paper investigates the effects of revealing partial information about available vacancies on
 the distribution of teachers across schools. To identify this effect I exploit a quasi-experimental
 variation provided by the information disclosure policy in Italy’s centralized teacher assignment.
 Information about available vacancies is released by Provincial Offices of Education. However, due
 to lack of coordination, some offices may not release, or not release in time, this information. Using
 comprehensive administrative data on tenured teacher applications and webscraped data on public
 announcements about teacher retirements, I use plausible exogenous variation in announcements
 across years and provinces in a difference-in-differences strategy. I provide novel evidence on the
 role of information disclosure in shaping teacher distribution across schools. I show that there are
 within-province distributional effects (i) within temporary contract teachers and tenured teachers
 and, (ii) within less experienced tenured teachers and more experienced tenured teachers.

                            Most secondary schools in England are able to design the rules for which pupils
                            have priority when the school is over-subscribed. 
                            This could be positive or negative for inclusivity, depending on schools’ choices. 
                            In this context, we study the detailed rules for each secondary school in England. 
                            Our main findings are that, first, geography (still) determines admission to most 
                            over-subscribed schools. This matters for social mobility, as some households 
                            are priced out of high performing schools due to higher property prices around 
                            the school. Second, despite explicit financial incentives, only a small minority 
                            of schools give priority to pupils eligible for the Pupil Premium, and this
                            priority is meaningful only in a few dozen schools. Third, the few schools 
                            with ‘innovative’ admissions arrangements could inspire other schools to implement 
                            feasible ‘tried and tested’ reforms. Free schools appear to be leading
                            these ‘innovative’ admissions arrangements. Finally, in the complex system of 
                            multiple school types and diverse admissions arrangements, parents in some areas
                            lack the required information to make informed school choices.

                            This paper explores the effect of language proficiency on Math achievement for ten-year-old
                second-generation immigrant children in Italian primary schools. Especially for these children, proficiency
                in the host country language is the prerequisite for the acquisition of any other skill. However, using an
                instrumental variable strategy that exploits the heterogeneity in birth dates and the variation in linguistic
                distances, we find that they face a trade-off between learning Italian and learning Math. The linguistic
                literature offers an explanation based on the existence of a language proficiency threshold that must be
                crossed to understand the classes. On this basis, we develop a simple model of skill production that provides
                theoretical foundations for our results and a unified framework for interpreting the mixed findings in the
                literature. We present empirical evidence that the trade-off arises when proficiency is below the threshold
                commonly adopted to indicate a sufficient command of the Italian language, which happens for 59% of
                our sample. Enabling these children to catch up requires substantial investments in education since, when
                a sufficiency threshold must be crossed, marginal improvements are ineffective, rendering the proficiency
                gap permanent and fostering social exclusion and inequality.
